# SYN100 Game

SYN100 is a narrative decision game where the player answers 10 alien protocol questions that determine Earth’s fate.

Each answer changes a hidden Communication Score from -10 to +10. Choices that show empathy, adaptability, and non-human perspective-taking increase the score, while human-centered or dominant framing lowers it.

At the end, the game reveals whether Earth is spared or destroyed, then generates a structured AI analysis that explains each question’s impact and gives an overall outcome summary.
